# Softgrid-Task
 I have worked on Following files in theme(softgridapi) folder: <br />
 Function.php (For api, custom code, Ajax Code)<br /> 
 Footer.php (For adding JS)<br />
 dashbaord-api.php (For showing api request data by partner) <br />
 
 I have create custom post type (shop) and created get api. When we hit api, we get only shop type post. <br />
 There is validation for partner, need to add user id. <br />
 Get Api Url example: <br />
 http://localhost/softgrid/wp-json/v2/api-get/shop/partner_id/2
